        <p>I am an aspiring developer looking to debug, build and deploy your applications! My undergraduate is in
             the soft sciences and I now have completed a full stack web development programming bootcamp to
             supplement my cloud administration skills.
        </p>
        <p>
            My interests are cloud management whether serverless or traditionally structured, deploying applications, 
            automating work flows, writing tests, debugging, full stack development, cheesing 4x strategy games and MOBAs.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am currently looking for rewarding full time work as well as interesting open source projects to hack on.
